Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to read, understand, and generate human language. NLP tasks include text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, and question answering.

Popular NLP techniques involve tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and embedding representations. Embeddings, like Word2Vec, GloVe, and transformer-based embeddings, map words or sentences into high-dimensional vectors for similarity computations and downstream tasks.
