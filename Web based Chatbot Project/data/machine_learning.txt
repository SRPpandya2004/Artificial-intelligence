Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming. It uses algorithms to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions.

Common types of ML include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning trains agents based on rewards and penalties. Machine learning powers applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition, and autonomous vehicles.
